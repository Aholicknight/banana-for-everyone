# Banana+ addon for Meteor Client

By: Bennooo.

### How to use:  
- Build the jar file.
- Run the mod with Meteor.

### Will this get updates?
As of right now i don't plan on it, i'll maybe keep updateing it to newer meteor versions and if you guys are lucky some smaller stuff.

### Personal note: 
This started off as a passion project just for me and necro and I think itâ€™s insane how far this actually went. From a meteor prefix to a skid to finally a masterpiece. Thank you all for supporting this project, shits unreal! Sad that this shit happened tho.
