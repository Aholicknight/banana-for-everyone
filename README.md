# Banana+ addon for Meteor Client

By: Bennooo and Necro.

### How to use:  
- Build the jar file.
- Run the mod with Meteor.

### Personal note: 
This started off as a passion project just for me and necro and I think itâ€™s insane how far this actually went. From a meteor prefix to a skid to finally a masterpiece.   Thank you all for supporting this project, shits unreal! Sad that it had to end like this tho.
