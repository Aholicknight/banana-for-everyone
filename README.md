### How to use:
- Download and open with GitHub Desktop
- Open the project through IntelliJ
- Run the gradle `build` task and wait
- Use the jar from the `build/libs` folder

### Will this get updates?
Probably! Ricky is currently working on fixing bugs and learning Java, Ben is maybe working on new modules entirely? But those will be added at his leisure since this is no longer a necessity :pray:

### Personal Note From Ben: 
This started off as a passion project just for me and necro, and I think itâ€™s insane how far this actually went. From a meteor prefix to a skid to finally a masterpiece. Thank you all for supporting this project, shits unreal! Sad that this shit happened tho.

B+ on top, All love <3  -ben
